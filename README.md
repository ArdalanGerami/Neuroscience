Including Neuroscience projects
1. Processing and analyzing the LFP dataset
  - Preprocessing, including bandpass filter, extract trials, and z-score
  - Calculating and plotting different regionsâ€™ ERP, ERSP, PSD, and wPLI.
  - Effect of odorants on the functional connectivity of the brain
  - Calculating PSD and average power of theta band.
2. Preprocessing the LFP dataset
  - including bandpass filter, epoching the data according to each event, and z-score.
  - plotting ERP, PLV, PAC, and TV-PAC to analyze the effect of odorants on brain functional connectivity.
3. Fine Tuning AlexNet on voxel activations
  - In this project, calculating the Pearson coefficient of observed and predicted dissimilarity values for different layers of AlexNet and comparing them for two specific brain regions (V1 & LOC) showed that fine-tuning a pre-trained AlexNet improves the correlation         significantly in layers, especially the middle ones.
4. Deep Q networks
  - Implementing an Agent in an online learning environment.
  - Utilizing the Agent in a practical Maze Solving problem.
  - Manipulating constants to achieve the maximum score.
